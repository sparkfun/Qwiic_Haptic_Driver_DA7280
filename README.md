The SparkFun Qwiic Haptic Driver includes an itty-bitty, Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA) vibration motor and Dialog Semiconductor's DA7280 motor driver IC for applications that require haptic feedback. The kit is intended for applications where the vibration motor needs to be mounted separately from the board. Please be aware that you will need to manually solder the wires and motor to the board.

Control the vibration motor with the DA7280 via I<sup>2</sup>C, PWM, or a combination of three general purpose input pins. Utilizing our handy Qwiic system, no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still include 0.1"-spaced PTH pads in case you prefer to use a breadboard to access the driver's I<sup>2</sup>C, power, interrupt, and general purpose input pins on the edge of the board.

This board is great for projects that require a physical indicator whenever an event is triggered. Add it to your remote control to notify you when your robot has hit a wall. Combine it with an accelerometer to remind you to correct your posture. Or use it with a distance sensor to alert you when a ninja is walking up to you at your desk.
